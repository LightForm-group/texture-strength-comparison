Example Data
-----------

Example data files can be downloaded from Zenodo. Please download these data files and unzip them into this folder, to run an example analysis with texture-strength-comparison.

Texture intensity values from a series of synchrotron measurements recorded as a stage-scan (X-Y) across a pre-rolled Ti-6Al-4V sample can be downloaded from 103845.zip in [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Results - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7319352), for creating plots of the texture variation and to produce 2D texture intensity maps. These can be compared with the texture variation recorded using an EBSD map that had been divided into equivalent sized squares as were used for the synchrotron analysis, by downloading ebsd.zip in [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Results - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7319352).

Texture intensity data for the Diamond 2017 experiment, and for the DESY 2020 and 2021 experiments is available on request by emailing christopher.daniel@manchester.ac.uk
