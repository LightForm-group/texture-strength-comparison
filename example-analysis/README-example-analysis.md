Example Analysis
-----------

Example analysis files can be downloaded from Zenodo. Please download these analysis files and unzip them into this folder, to compare with the outputs from your example analysis with texture-strength-comparison.

Plots of the texture variation and 2D texture intensity maps, from a series of synchrotron measurements recorded as a stage-scan (X-Y) across a pre-rolled Ti-6Al-4V sample, can be downloaded from texture-strength-comparison.zip in [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Results - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7319352). This also includes the texture variation recorded using an EBSD map that had been divided into equivalent sized squares as were used for the synchrotron analysis.

Analysis files for the Diamond 2017 experiment, and for the DESY 2020 and 2021 experiments are available on request by emailing christopher.daniel@manchester.ac.uk
